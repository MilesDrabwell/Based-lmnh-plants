## Testing 
- `test_fetch_data.py`

This file will test for if it's actually getting called and if it's getting called exactly once.
<br>It will also test that an exception is raised when an id is inserted that isn't a number (integer technically).
<br>We decided not to test the actual integer as even though we have 50 plants right now, this number may change.
<br>We also checked the coverage and it gave 95% which we are happy with so moved on.
